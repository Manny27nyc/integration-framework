# LaunchDarkly integrations

Feature flags not only provide you control over your deployment and rollout, but
also provides context to other related systems -- giving your team visibility
into how your services react due to changes to flags. This repository contains
LaunchDarkly integrations built by our community. Most of these integrations
consume events from LaunchDarkly in order to provide their users more context.
